Educational Video Rewards

## Project Description
The **Educational Video Rewards** contract allows content creators to submit educational videos and earn rewards in the form of ether for their contributions. Creators can submit a unique video hash and claim rewards once their video is validated. The contract ensures fair reward distribution and provides the owner the ability to fund the contract for continuous rewards.

## Contract Address
0xde0a06a1685757458088446373e4fb432cb81c85

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to create a decentralized platform where educational content creators are rewarded for their contributions. By utilizing blockchain technology, this platform ensures transparency and fairness in the reward distribution process, providing an incentive for creators to share valuable educational content with the community.

## Key Features
- **Reward per Video Submission**: Each video submission earns the creator a fixed reward in ether, which is set by the contract owner.
- **Unique Video Hash Submission**: Each video can only be submitted once, ensuring no duplicates and maintaining content originality.
- **Reward Claiming**: Creators can claim their earned rewards at any time, provided the contract has sufficient funds.
- **Owner Control**: The contract owner can update the reward per video and fund the contract to ensure it remains operational.
- **Contract Funding**: The owner can add ether to the contract balance to ensure rewards can be paid out to creators.
- **Security and Integrity**: The contract checks for duplicate submissions, ensures the contract balance is sufficient before rewards are claimed, and includes fallback mechanisms for handling unexpected ether transfers.
